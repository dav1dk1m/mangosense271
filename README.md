## Problem description
After the pandemic, Regina Food Bank has been dealing with a high volume of calls and increasing call drops. With that new CRM tool has been approached to the Food Bank system and the situation got a little tricky. What are some better design systems for both customers and Food bank? 

## Summary
Our project will update and increase the functionality of GET HELP page, also adding the texting bot that would allow users to answer their questions without phone call. This allows user with better interaction with food bank, and put less stress on call center.

## Northstar & Carryover customers
Northstar customers is John Bailey, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) – Regina Food Bank (RFB)

Carryover customer is the Regina Food Bank. 

## Project Assumption
We are going to use NodeJS, MongoDB, and React for the realization of the project. NodeJS for chatbot systems and functions, MongoDB for storing user’s sign-up pieces of information and React for user interfaces.


## Project Constraints
Since some plugins on WordPress don’t have an admin part or they need to be upgraded to a pro version, we needed to explore and test our chatbot on another platform.
