## Problem description
After the pandemic, Regina Food Bank has been dealing with a high volume of calls and increasing call drops. With that new CRM tool has been approached to the Food Bank system and the situation got a little tricky. What are some better design systems for both customers and Food bank? 

## Summary
Our project will update and increase the functionality of GET HELP page, also adding the texting bot that would allow users to answer their questions without phone call. This allows user with better interaction with food bank, and put less stress on call center.

## Northstar & Carryover customers
Northstar customers are long-term users of the food bank since they will be delightful to find the improvement of the food bank services.

Carryover customers are one or two-time users. It is likely that if these new users are satisfied with the design, other users are willing to choose that as well.

## Project Assumption
We are going to use NodeJS, python and WordPress, for the realization of the project. NodeJS for server side and frontend. Python for bot algorithms.


## Project Constraints
While making a chatbot for the FOOD BANK, the one main constraint is a lack of experience and knowledge. We will need to have a good quality outcome in the limited time we have to solve the majority of problems.
